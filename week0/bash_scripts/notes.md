## Bash scripting

to write a bash file use the file extension "' .sh '"

similar to c, we give libraries using "' #! '" and the general library is "' #!/bin/bash '"

after writing the script, save the file and run basj <filename>

# assigning variables

just type, **variable**="value";(no space anywhere)

# creating prompts

use echo to ask for prompt
then type, "' read **variable** '"
later while giving output, use $**variable** to display the value.

# using loops
 1. count controlled loops: 
 FORMAT: ---------
                  |
                  |
                  |
                  V
    for ((**variable**=0;**variable**<n;**variable**++))do
    echo....
    done
